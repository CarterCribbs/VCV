# VCV

This repository contains the code I wrote for VCV digital 
during my summer internship. 

In the code I use selenium to fetch electricity data from the web.
I then use pandas to manipulate the data and produce a graph charting 
historical energy prices.

The graph is then sent to the CEO using the smtplib module (automated email messaging framework).

This process was automated to run daily.
